Those scanners may require authentication, so they're automatically skipped when no authentication credentials are found. Configuration Note that all scanners use environment variables for configuration values. You can define an environment variable inline or put them in a file called .env in the current directory. The tool will parse it automatically. To specify another filename, use the flag --env-file . Example # .env.local NUMVERIFY_API_KEY = \"value\" GOOGLECSE_CX = \"value\" GOOGLE_API_KEY = \"value\" phoneinfoga scan -n +4176418xxxx --env-file = .env.local Building your own scanner PhoneInfoga can now be extended with plugins! You can build your own scanner and PhoneInfoga will use it to scan the given phone number. $ phoneinfoga scan -n +4176418xxxx --plugin ./custom_scanner.so Info Plugins are written with the Go programming language . To get started, see this example plugin . Local The local scan is probably the simplest scan of PhoneInfoga. By default, the tool statically parse the phone number and convert it to several formats, it also tries to recognize the country and the carrier. This information are passed to all scanners in order to provide further analysis. The local scanner simply return those information to the end user, so they can exploit it as well. Configuration There is no configuration required for this scanner. Output example $ phoneinfoga scan -n +4176418xxxx Results for local Raw local: 076418xxxx Local: 076 418 xx xx E164: +4176418xxxx International: 4176418xxxx Country: CH Numverify Numverify provide standard but useful information such as country code, location, line type and carrier. This scanners requires an API-key which you can get on their website after creating an account. You can use a free API key as long as you don't exceed the monthly quota. Read documentation Configuration Go to the Api layer website and create an account Go to \"Number Verification API\" in the marketplace, click on \"Subscribe for free\", then choose whatever plan you want Copy the new API token and use it as an environment variable Environment variable Default Description NUMVERIFY_API_KEY API key to authenticate to the Numverify API. Output example $ NUMVERIFY_API_KEY = <key> phoneinfoga scan -n +4176418xxxx Results for numverify Valid: true Number: 4176418xxxx Local format: 076418xxxx International format: +4176418xxxx Country prefix: +41 Country code: CH Country name: Switzerland ( Confederation of ) Carrier: Sunrise Communications AG Line type: mobile Googlesearch Googlesearch uses the Google search engine and Google Dorks to search phone number's footprints everywhere on the web. It allows you to search for scam reports, social media profiles, documents and more. This scanner does only one thing: generating several Google search links from a given phone number. You then have to manually open them in your browser to see results. So the tool may generate links that do not return any result. This is a design choice we made to avoid technical limitation around Google scraping . You can however, use this scanner through the REST API in addition with another tool to fetch the result automatically. If you wish to retrieve results automatically, see Googlecse scanner instead. Configuration There is no configuration required for this scanner.

Googlecse Google custom search is a Google product allowing users to create Programmable Search Engines for programmatic usage. This scanner takes an existing search engine you created to perform search queries on a given phone number. Custom Search JSON API provides 100 search queries (~50 scans) per day for free. If you need more, you may sign up for billing in the API Console. Additional requests cost $5 per 1000 queries (~500 scans), up to 10k queries per day (~5000 scans) . Follow the steps below to create a new search engine : Go to GCP console and enable the custom search API. Go to the credentials page and create a new API token. You can restrict this token to the Custom Search API. Follow this link and click on \"Add\" to create a new search engine. Fill the form and make sure you select \"Search the entire web\". Use the Search Engine ID and the API token to configure the scanner as per the configuration tab below. Configuration Environment variable Default Description GOOGLECSE_CX Search engine ID. GOOGLE_API_KEY API key to authenticate to the Google API. GOOGLECSE_MAX_RESULTS 10 Maximum results for each request. Each 10 results requires an additional request. This value cannot go above 100. Output example $ phoneinfoga scan -n +1241325xxxx Results for googlecse Homepage: https://cse.google.com/cse?cx = <redacted> Result count: 1 Items: Title: Info about +1241325xxxx URL: https://example.com/1241325xxxx OVH OVH, besides being a web and cloud hosting company, is a telecom provider with several VoIP numbers in Europe.

With E.164 formatting, this '0' must usually be removed. For example, here\u2019s a UK-based number in standard local formatting: 020 7183 8750 Here\u2019s the same phone number in E.164 formatting: +442071838750 Custom formatting Sometimes the phone number has footprints but is used with a different formatting. This is a problem because for example if we search for \"+15417543010\", we'll not find web pages that write it that way : \"(541) 754\u20133010\". You should use a format that someone of the number's country would usually use to share the phone number online. For example, French people usually write numbers that way online : 06.20.30.40.50 or 06 20 30 40 50 . For US-based numbers, the most common format is : 543-456-1234 .

With E.164 formatting, this '0' must usually be removed. For example, here\u2019s a UK-based number in standard local formatting: 020 7183 8750 Here\u2019s the same phone number in E.164 formatting: +442071838750","title":"Basics"},{"location":"resources/formatting/#custom-formatting","text":"Sometimes the phone number has footprints but is used with a different formatting. This is a problem because for example if we search for \"+15417543010\", we'll not find web pages that write it that way : \"(541) 754\u20133010\". You should use a format that someone of the number's country would usually use to share the phone number online. For example, French people usually write numbers that way online : 06.20.30.40.50 or 06 20 30 40 50 .
